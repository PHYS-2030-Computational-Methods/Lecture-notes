    "Let's continue the discussion of __initial value problems__ (IVPs). We introduced Euler's method, the simplest algorithm for solving IVPs but also the least accurate. As a first-order method, the global error scales proportional to $h$, or with $1/N$, where $N$ is the number of steps over a fixed interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we consider __second-order methods__. The idea is that each step is accurate including terms *quadratic* in $h$. Now, $\\mathcal{O}(h^3)$ terms are neglected, and therefore the local error (per step) is proportional to $h^3$ and the global error is proportional to $h^2$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Higher-order methods can offer a dramatic improvement in the performance of the algorithm. Suppose we require $N=10^6$ steps to achieve a certain level of accuracy with Euler's method. For a second-order method, we only require $N=10^3$ steps to achieve a similar accuracy. \n",

    "Euler's method and the midpoint method are part of a general family of algorithms known as __Runge-Kutta (RK) methods__ for solving IVPs. Euler's method is the unique first-order RK algorithm with one stage (RK1). At second order, there is a family of two-stage algorithms (RK2), of which the midpoint method is one example. In practice, the algorithms that are widely used in numerical solutions to IVPs are four-stage algorithms (RK4), which are fourth-order methods. A variant of RK4 is used in `scipy.integrate.solve_ivp`. There are videos online describing [RK2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihEfPp5WRcE) and [RK4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGN54bkE8Ac) that are highly recommended.\n",

    "Now, in principle, we are done. If we can calculate derivatives of $f(t,y)$ analytically, we can use those to compute $y''(t)$ (and if we want to go beyond second order, we could calculate higher derivatives as well). On the other hand, it is very useful to consider an alternative approach where we *do not* need to evaluate derivatives of $f(t,y)$.
