Monte Carlo methods are a tool that uses *random sampling* to compute quantities where analytic methods may be very complicated or impossible. (It is named after the famous casino in Monaco.) This is not a course on probabilities and statistics. However, we will borrow many concepts from these topics.\n",

    "Let's return to the simple sampling problem from Example 4. Let's discuss the meaning of what we are doing in terms of PDFs.\n",

    "$$P(x) = \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{cc} \\frac{1}{20} & {\\rm for} \\; -10 \\le x \\le 10 \\\\ 0 & {\\rm otherwise} \\end{array} \\right. \\, .$$\n",

    "\n",
    "$$\\mu = \\overline{x} = \\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty} dx \\; x \\; P(x) = \\frac{1}{20} \\int_{-10}^{+10} x  = 0 \\, ,$$\n",
    "\n",
    "as expected. However, what we are interested in is the mean of bike ride time $t(x)$. This is calculated using the PDF\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\overline{t(x)} = \\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty} dx \\; t(x) \\; P(x) = \\frac{1}{20} \\int_{-10}^{+10} dx \\; \\frac{1000}{8 - 0.5 x} \\; .$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In words, we are using the PDF to average $t(x)$ over all possible wind speeds $x$, with each $x$ value given the appropriate probability $P(x)$. (In this case, all $x$ values have the same probability.) \n",
    "\n",
    "*A word of caution:* the mean of a function, in this case $\\overline{t(x)}$, is *not* the same as taking the function evaluated at the mean, $t(\\bar{x})$. In this case, $\\bar{x} = 0$ and $t(0) = 125\\; {\\rm s}$ is the wrong answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, let's compare our results from Example 4. The above integral can be performed analytically to get $\\overline{t(x)} = 146.634 \\; {\\rm s}$. This is the *true answer*, while our sampling result in Example 4 was only the *approximate* answer, which in turns becomes a better and better approximation as $N$ is increased.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's also look at the distribution of our samples for $t(x)$ using a histogram. The following code does the following:\n",
    "- Generates samples for $x$, sampling from a uniform distribution as usual.\n",
    "- Generates samples for $t$ using our $x$ samples. That is, for each $x_i$, we calculate the corresponding $t$ value $t_i = t(x_i)$.\n",

    "Monte Carlo sampling is a computational tool that allows us to approximate quantities (e.g., means) where there is an element of randomness or probability involved. Given the PDF $P(x)$, we can in principle calculate any quantity we want be performing a sum (if $x$ is a discrete variable) or an integral (if $x$ in continuous) to calculate any true mean. On the other hand, Monte Carlo sampling lets us make an approximation for any true mean, which improves for large $N$. \n",
    "\n",
    "For complex problems, calculating a true mean analytically may turn out to be very complex. On the other hand, Monte Carlo sampling can turn out to be a much more tractable approach, provided we have enough computational resources to take $N$ to be large.\n",
    "\n",
    "To decide how large $N$ needs to be, we look at the *standard error on the mean* for whatever quantity we are computing. Once the error falls below our desired accuracy, we can declare victory."
